            <h2>GreenWorld - Where Education Meets Practice for a Greener Environment</h2>

            <p>At GreenWorld, we go beyond providing a strong educational foundation by fostering a deep sense of environmental consciousness among our students. We regularly organize free seminars and lectures for students, covering preventive measures, environmental issues, and their impact on public health.</p>

            <p>To capture attention and encourage active participation in environmental protection, we've implemented engaging interactive activities. Students have the opportunity to participate in field trips to various environmentally significant locations.</p>

            <p>Alongside extracurricular activities, GreenWorld places great emphasis on evaluating the effectiveness of our environmental programs. However, to minimize paper usage, we're transitioning to online surveys.</p>

            <p>We are currently developing an online survey portal to gather student feedback on environmental protection activities. Through this portal, students can easily participate in surveys and contribute to improving our environmental programs and activities.</p>

            <p>Join GreenWorld, and let's work together for a greener, cleaner, and more beautiful environment!</p>
